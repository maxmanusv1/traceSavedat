# traceSavedat
<h2> simple save.dat tracer for Growtopia. </h2> 
<h4> Whats difference between my other trace save.dat application? <br>
  here its btw: https://github.com/maxmanusv1/Growtopia-Trace-Savedat // i dont recommend to use this.</h4>

-i used changedEvent for File so this is will be better solution to trace save.dat. on my previosly application i was using timer, that was so dumb lol. <br>
-i added lastworld logger. <br>
-its can log all things in private hidden folder. <br>
-clean code. <br>

<h5> q: how should i use this? </h5>
<h6>a: i just did trace save.dat so i didnt add anything to post this logs to somewhere. you can post logs to your database or you can just post log files to your discord webhook etc. however you want.</h6>

<h5> q: what is best way to use this application? </h5>
<h6> a: i think you should have add this application to startup and add some timers. so you can get logs hour by hour or when you want. </h6>

<br>
--- there is can be bugs or somethings. i didnt try to fix them. you will need to handle it

here its how works:<br>
